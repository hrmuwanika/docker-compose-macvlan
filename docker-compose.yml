# Ports section technically is not needed since using vlan means traffic can go trough all ports regardless of port mapping.
# Port mapping does not work with vlan. If you need any mapping/filtering/blacklisting/whitelisting etc. - do it on the firewall.
# However you can keep it commented as a placeholder for quick look-up which ports are being used by default if need be or getting rid of vlan.
#    ports:
#      - 8000:8000
